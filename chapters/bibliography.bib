	abstract = {The topic of cosmic strings provides a bridge between the physics of the very small and the very large. They are predicted by some unified theories of particle interactions. If they exist, they may help to explain some of the largest-scale structures seen in the Universe today. They are 'topological defects' that may have been formed at phase transitions in the very early history of the Universe, analogous to those found in some condensed matter systems-vortex lines in liquid helium, flux tubes in type-II superconductors, or disclination lines in liquid crystals. In this review, we describe what they are, why they have been hypothesized and what their cosmological implications would be. The relevant background from the standard models of particle physics and cosmology is described in section 1. In section 2, we review the idea of symmetry breaking in field theories, and show how the defects formed are constrained by the topology of the manifold of degenerate vacuum states. We also discuss the different types of cosmic strings that can appear in different field theories. Section 3 is devoted to the dynamics of cosmic strings, and section 4 to their interaction with other fields. The formation and evolution of cosmic strings in the early Universe is the subject of section 5, while section 6 deals with their observational implications. Finally, the present status of the theory is reviewed in section 7.}

In a recent paper{,} Vromans and Giomi [Soft Matter{,} 2016{,} 12{,} 6490] pointed out that topological defects are not point-like objects but actually have orientational properties{,} which strongly affect the energetics and motion of the defects. That paper developed a mathematical formalism which describes the orientational properties as vectors. Here{,} we agree with the basic concept of defect orientation{,} but we suggest an alternative mathematical formalism. We represent the defect orientation by a tensor{,} with a rank that depends on the topological charge: rank 1 for a charge of +1/2{,} rank 3 for a charge of −1/2. Using this tensor formalism{,} we calculate the orientation-dependent interaction between defects{,} and we present numerical simulations of defect motion."}

abstract = {It is known that certain spontaneously broken gauge theories give rise to stable strings or vortex lines. In this paper it is shown that under certain conditions such strings behave like superconducting wires whose passage through astrophysical magnetic fields would generate a variety of striking and perhaps observable effects. The superconducting charge carriers may be either bosons (if a charged Higgs field has an expectation value in the core of the string) or fermions (if charged fermions are trapped in zero modes along the string, as is known to occur in certain circumstances). They might be observable as synchrotron sources or as sources of high-energy cosmic rays. If the charge carriers are ordinary quarks and leptons, the strings have important baryon number violating interactions with magnetic fields; such a string, traversing a galactic magnetic field of 10−6 G, creates baryons (or antibaryons) at a rate of order 1012 particles/cm of string per second.}

Their eventual discovery would lead to significant advances in both cosmology and fundamental physics. One of the most effective ways to detect cosmic strings is through their lensing signatures which appear to be significantly different from those introduced by standard lenses (i.e. compact clumps of matter). In 2003, the discovery of the peculiar object CSL-1 raised the interest of the physics community since its morphology and spectral features strongly argued in favour of it being the first case of gravitational lensing by a cosmic string. In this paper we provide a detailed description of the expected observational effects of a cosmic string and show, by means of simulations, the lensing signatures produced on background galaxies. While high angular resolution images obtained with Hubble Space Telescope, revealed that CSL-1 is a pair of interacting ellipticals at redshift 0.46, it represents a useful lesson to plan future surveys.}",

abstract = {Cosmic strings generate vector and tensor modes in the B-channel of polarisation, as well as the usual temperature power spectrum and E-mode polarisation spectrum. We use the power spectrum obtained from high-resolution Nambu-Goto cosmic string simulations together with the Planck and BICEP2 likelihoods to explore the degeneracies appearing between cosmic strings and other cosmological parameters in different inflationary scenarios, as well as the constraints that can be imposed on cosmic strings in each of these situations. In standard ΛCDM, the Planck likelihood yields an upper  limit Gμ&lt;1.49 × 10−7 (95% confidence). We also analyse the possibility of explaining the BB power spectrum signal recently detected by the BICEP2 probe. We find that cosmic strings alone are able to explain only part of the B-mode polarisation signal. Apart from the standard ΛCDM model, we look at the following non-minimal parameters: the running of the spectral index, non-zero tensor-to-scalar ratio, additional degrees of freedom (Neff) and sterile neutrinos. We find that in both Planck and BICEP2 scenarios adding Neff induces degeneracies between cosmic strings and Neff and other ΛCDM parameters. With Neff a larger contribution from cosmic strings is allowed, even favoured, but after combining with large-scale structure data, such as BAOs, strings remain strongly constrained.}
