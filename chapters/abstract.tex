It is generally assumed that through the so-called \textit{Kibble mechanism} objects called topological defects could have formed in the early universe. In this thesis we discuss a model beyond the Standard Model that permits a type of topological defects called \textit{cosmic strings}. In order to study cosmic string solutions, we first promote the global symmetry U$(1)_{B-L}$ to a local symmetry and add a new gauge coupling. The cancellation of gauge anomalies is achieved by adding a right-handed neutrino to each lepton generation. More\-over, a new Higgs field is added in order to give mass to the right-handed neutrino.  
Finally, we study the field equations of motion of the two Higgs fields and the gauge field, in order to obtain the profiles of the cosmic strings. We compute this profile numerically and discuss their physical meaning. Particularly we found a type of solutions that we call coaxial cosmic strings.  In addition, we obtained the string tension which is of the order of $10^{19}\,\text{GeV}^2$ and its gravitational coupling $\sim 10^{-30}$ which is below from the constrictions obtained by the LIGO collaboration.
