First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor Dr.\ Bietenholz, without him this thesis could never have been done. I am really grateful for his  insightful comments, and patience over these years under his guidance.

I acknowledge financial support from \ESP{\textit{programa de becas nacionales}} of the CONACYT and an additional scholarship from the project DGAPA-PAPIIT IG100322 ``\textit{Materia fuertemente acoplada en condiciones extremas con el MPD-NICA}''. 

In addition, I would like to acknowledge Víctor Muñoz, who collaborated in the project and confirmed the equations of motion and the co-axial string solutions.
